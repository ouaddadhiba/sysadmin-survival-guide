# 🔴Issue #4: Boot Loop Troubleshooting: The Machine That Won’t Stay Up

> *“It starts… it flickers… then it dies. And restarts. Again.”*

---

You power on the system—lights flash, fans spin, the BIOS/UEFI screen flickers—then halfway through the boot process, it resets. Again. And again.  

You’re trapped in a cycle of:

- Power-on → POST → OS loader → brief progress → sudden reboot  
- No stable login prompt or desktop  
- Possible brief error flashes (too fast to read)  
- Recovery mode may fail or trigger the same loop  
- Logs may be inaccessible or wiped on each restart  

This isn’t just slow—it’s a **full boot loop**.  
Your system is stuck in purgatory between power and functionality.

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Diagnosis: Break the Cycle

> 🔐 **Survival Rule #1**: Don’t panic. Don’t force-shutdown repeatedly.  
> You might corrupt storage or lose critical logs.

### Step 1: Observe the Boot Sequence  
> *Where does it fail?*

Watch closely — or better, **record the screen with your phone** and replay it in slow motion.

- **Fails before GRUB or systemd-boot?**  
  → Likely hardware, firmware, or bootloader issue.

- **Fails after kernel loads (e.g., logo appears, then reset)?**  
  → Driver, filesystem, or configuration problem.

- **Fails during login or service startup?**  
  → User-space conflict, broken service, or corrupted profile.

> 💡 Use a smartphone to capture fast flashes of text — they often contain kernel panic messages or I/O errors.

### Step 2: Boot into Safe/Recovery Mode  
> *Can you escape the loop long enough to act?*

Try accessing:

- **Linux (GRUB)**:  
  Hold `Shift` (BIOS) or `Esc` (UEFI) during boot → select "Advanced options" → choose recovery mode.

- **Windows**:  
  Hold `Shift` while clicking Restart → Troubleshoot → Advanced Options → Startup Settings → Safe Mode.

👉 If **recovery mode also loops**, suspect deeper issues:  
- Hardware instability  
- Firmware corruption  
- Critical partition damage

---

### Step 3: Check Boot Logs (If Accessible)  
> *The truth is written in the logs — if you can read them.*

Use a **Live USB/CD** (e.g., Ubuntu Live, SystemRescue) to mount the system drive.

#### Mount the root partition:
```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/target
sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/target  # Adjust partition as needed
